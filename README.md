## PyOpenTranslate: Free and Unlimited Python Library for Translating Texts

PyOpenTranslate is a versatile and unrestricted Python library that empowers you to effortlessly translate texts across various languages. This library is designed to provide seamless translation capabilities without any limitations. Whether you're working on personal projects or professional applications, PyOpenTranslate streamlines the integration of text translation functionality into your Python codebase.

### Features

- Translate text between multiple languages with ease.
- Enjoy unlimited translation without restrictions.
- Handle translation errors gracefully using custom exceptions.

### Usage Example

Here's how you can use PyOpenTranslate to translate text in your Python code:

```python
from PyOpenTranslate import translate, TranslationError

try:
    translated_text = translate("Hello, how are you?", language="fr")
    print("Translated text:", translated_text)
except TranslationError as e:
    print("An error occurred:", e)
```

In this example, the `translate` function from the PyOpenTranslate library is employed to translate the text "Hello, how are you?" into French. If the translation process encounters an error, a `TranslationError` is raised and handled gracefully.

PyOpenTranslate simplifies the integration of text translation into your Python projects, enabling the creation of multilingual applications, enhancing user experiences, and facilitating communication across language barriers.
